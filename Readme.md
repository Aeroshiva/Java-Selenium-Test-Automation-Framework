## Prerequisites
Before running this framework, ensure the following configuration are installed on your system.
- **Java 11** installed and configured (JAVA_HOME)
- **Maven** installed and available in system PATH
    - Download Link: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

## Features

- **Cross-browser Testing** â€“ Execute tests across multiple browsers like Chrome and Firefox.
- **Cloud Execution with LambdaTest** â€“ Run tests on a wide range of OS and browser combinations in the cloud.
- **Headless Mode** â€“ Speed up test execution by running in headless mode.
- **Data-driven Testing** â€“ Easily run tests using dynamic input from CSV or Excel files using OpenCSV and Apache POI.
- **Fake Data Generation** â€“ Use the Faker library to inject realistic dummy data into test cases.
- **Reporting** â€“ Get detailed test execution insights via Extent Reports.
- **Logging** â€“ Track execution details and errors using Log4j with timestamped logs.
- **CI/CD Friendly** â€“ Ready to integrate with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and other CI/CD tools.

## Technologies Used
- Java 11
- TestNG â€“ Testing framework
- OpenCSV â€“ Data-driven testing from CSV files
- Gson â€“ JSON parsing and configuration
- Apache POI â€“ Excel data handling
- Faker â€“ Generating fake test data
- Extent Reports â€“ Test reporting

## Setup Instruction

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aeroshiva/Java-Selenium-Test-Automation-Framework.git

    cd Java-Selenium-Test-Automation-Framewor
```
    
**Run tests on LambdaTest:**
```bash
    mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false -X 
```
**Run headless tests locally:**
```bash
    mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadless=true -X 
```
## Reports & Logs

- **Extent Report** â€“ Generated at ./report.html.

  The report contains information on test cases executed, Passed, Failed, and Skipped, along with Screenshots for failed tests.  

- **Logs** â€“ Stored in the ./logs/ directory with date-time stamped log files

## Integrated the Projct with GitHub Actions
This Automation Framework is integrated with github actions. The tests will be executed 11:30PM IST every single day.

The reports will be archived in gh-pages branch
